              <p>I am delighted to provide a recommendation to recognize Iryna’s work and efforts in one of my projects. When Iryna joined and was given responsibility to support thr project team to implement IFS maintenance software, the project immediately gained traction from an IT perspective; previously lacking. Iryna work together, side by side with the team, interpreting the needs and actioning the deliverable providing the progress needed to enable go-live for the project. Without Iryna’s ability to work as part of the team, bringing her technical experience and knowledge to the table and work through challenges, the projected would not have enjoyed the success is has. Thanks Iryna, I look forward to any opportunity to network and work with you again in the future. </p>

                I worked with Iryna for three years. All this time, she worked directly under my supervision and has been managing several project teams, taking control and evaluating the progress of the projects. She has been allocating material, human, and financial resources. Her duties also included reporting to an IT steering committee about the projects’ achievements and risks.

                Iryna is a goal-oriented workaholic who can bring complex projects to successful completion in conditions of limited resources. I definitely would recommend her as a IT-program/project manager for a large mining, infrastructure, or industrial enterprise.
